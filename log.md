# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 11, 2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Wrote simple python to read and write a large excel file.

**Thoughts:** This was a chore I needed to get out of the way before starting a proper project.
I used the openpyxl library to succesfully read a file.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 2: March 12, 2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Started out on basic set up for a React App. Babel, Webpack, Less

**Thoughts**: So far I understand the basics of React. Component, JSX. This basic setup is a good way to start the journey to doing some cool stuff with React.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 3: March 13, 2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Imported Bootstrap into project and created a navbar

**Thoughts**: It's a bit difficult for me to visually design an interface on my own. I might resort to borrowing ideas from similar sites to the one I want to build. For now.
I basically want a site that'll help me with any daily challenges I decide to take on after this.

**Link(s) to work**: my Github repo for now..

### Day 4: March 14, 2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Added content to my page, a body header of sorts and two cards.

**Thoughts**: It's starting to come to life! Bootstrap makes it all very beautiful very easily. I've added two cards to represent the challenges I'm currently working on.

Note: I will give a detailed explanation of what I hope to achieve with this project later on..

**Link(s) to work**: N/A for now

### Day 5: March 15, 2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Created a new form to allow the addition of a new challenge

**Thoughts**: I can now see what this project will be about. Helping me manage and keep track of any #100DaysOfX challenges IO decide to take in the future. I might decide to do #100DaysOfMusic or #100DaysOfWriting.
Or any other time-bound challenges that might not be part of this series

**Link(s) to work**: N/A for now
